data\_extraction.R creates CSVs from combining data in the mturk directory (not pushed to GitHub), while data\_analysis.Rmd creates visualizations of the data.

# mturk

Analyses from Spring 2020 MTurk experiments run using nosub. Note that data\_extraction.R may not work due to directories having been moved around, but it should just be a matter of updating the parent directory.

# prolific

Analyses from Fall 2020 Prolific experiments run using proliferate.
