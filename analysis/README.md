### .RData

### .Rhistory

## Experiment data (combined)

### catch\_trials\_data.csv

Contains participant responses from catch trials (botcaptcha, sound check). Results are grouped by the user's hashed worker ID; these can be analyzed and used as exclusion criteria for trials data (see combined\_trials\_data.csv).

### combined\_trials\_data.csv

Contains participant trial response data, most notably slider responses and trial duration.

### subject\_info\_data.csv

Contains (optional) participant demographic information, such as age and level of education. Also contains area for participant feedback (!).

## Munging

## data\_analysis.Rmd

Generates visuals based on catch\_trials\_data.csv, combined\_trials\_data.csv, and subject\_info\_data.csv files (generated by data\_extraction.R, which should be run before data\_analysis.Rmd to ensure the most recent data collected is used).

## data\_extraction.R

Generates catch\_trials\_data.csv, combined\_trials\_data.csv, and subject\_info\_data.csv when run. (Any older versions are automatically overwritten, so there is no need to delete them beforehand.) This assumes that the experimental data from MTurk is saved in mturk/production-results.
