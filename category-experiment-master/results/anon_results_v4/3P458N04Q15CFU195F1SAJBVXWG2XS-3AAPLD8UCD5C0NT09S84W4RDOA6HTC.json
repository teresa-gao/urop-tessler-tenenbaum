I didn't realize that it's normal for blickets to not squeak until I moved on and saw the next screen. I feel that some people will return the HIT and not complete it because they'll become confused and think the HIT has a glitch. That's what I initially thought and at the last second I just thought I'd click through to the next screen to report it or see what was stated next. ",
