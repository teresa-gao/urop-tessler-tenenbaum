### notes from lunch with peng 12/13/18

"basic prediction" is not so obvious:
- if you assume weak sampling, specific gives you less information than generic, which could lead to more exploration than with the generic
- if you assume strong sampling ("contrastive 'this'"), then the prediction does hold (but current 1-utterance condition is ambiguous between strong and weak sampling)

- peng agrees that 2-utterance version should yield strong sampling

- 3 dimensions of interest
  - sampling assumption (strong vs. weak)
  - observation evidence (0%, 100%, ...)
  - speaker reliability (my feeling is still that we want to "clamp" this to not be in question)
