Free response data (with other data)

Explanation of columns:

-   pass = passed attention checks
-   worked = did the blickets you tested squeak?
-   reasoning = why or why not?
-   n = number of items tested
-   t = time exploring (in minutes)
-   prob = probability that next blicket will squeak
-   gen = "Blickets squeak" true or false?
-   teach = what would you tell the children?
